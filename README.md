## Introduction

This program will simulate the basic movement of individual chess pieces.

### Information

The program starts with an interactive menu created by the the switch-case funcion, one for every piece in this simulation.

The pieces have pre-estabilished movements:

 - Tower moves 5 houses to the right;
 - Bishop moves 5 to top right;
 - Queen moves 8 to the left;
 - Horse moves Top Right.

For the movements of Tower and Queen there are void functions controling the recursive loop, the tower moving "Right" and the queen "Left".

For bishop movement there is a nested loop that will print "Top Right" five times.

Lastly, the horse movement uses a loop with an if function inside it. That way the loop will print "Top" 2 times and than, when the variable reaches the desired value, it prints "Right".
